## üéØ Objective
Strengthen foundational Linux and SOC analyst skills by:
- Exploring critical log files (`auth.log`, `syslog`, `kern.log`, `dmesg`)
- Understanding how everyday system actions appear in logs
- Practicing real-time log monitoring with `tail -f`
- Researching log entries to connect system behavior to security meaning

## üß≠ System Reconnaissance

Before diving into logs, I ran basic recon commands to re-familiarize myself with Linux:

```bash
whoami                     # current user
uname -a                   # system info
uptime                     # system load and uptime
df -h                      # disk space
du -sh /var/log            # disk use in log folder
top                        # processes
ps aux | less              # all running processes
```
These give me a quick snapshot of the system‚Äôs state ‚Äî perfect for baselining before analysis.

### Exploring Logs

```bash
cd /var/log
ls
```
I began examining the most important log files for SOC analysts:
```bash
cat auth.log      # login attempts, sudo usage, SSH logins
cat syslog        # system-wide events
cat kern.log      # kernel-level activity
cat dmesg         # device and boot messages
```
### auth.log
While reviewing auth.log, I saw this line:

add 'jenna' to shadow group 'adm'

I wasn‚Äôt sure what ‚Äúshadow group‚Äù meant ‚Äî research showed it indicates that Jenna was added to the adm group, which has access to system logs.

SOC Insight:
In a real environment, that‚Äôs an elevation of privilege event worth verifying.

Command used to trace it:
```bash
grep "add" "jenna" /var/log/auth.log
```

This revealed who performed the change and when ‚Äî confirming it was expected.

### Watching logs in real time
To see how my actions appear live:

Terminal 1 (monitoring):
```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log
```

Terminal 2 (activity):
```bash
sudo ls /root
```

I intentionally entered a wrong password first, then the correct one.
Back in Terminal 1, I saw:

authentication failure for user jenna

Direct proof that my failed login attempt was logged ‚Äî great real-time visibility.

### syslog
Running:
```bash
cat syslog
```

I noticed:

negative trust anchors

That sounded suspicious, so I researched it.

A trust anchor is a known-good cryptographic key used in DNSSEC.
The message ‚Äúnegative trust anchors‚Äù means the system skips DNSSEC validation for internal/private zones ‚Äî normal behavior!

A suspicious variation would be:

systemd-resolved: DNSSEC validation failed for github.com

That could indicate DNS spoofing or tampering attempts.

### kern.log
```bash
cat kern.log
```
I found:

long readout interval, skipping watchdog check

‚ÄúWatchdog‚Äù is a hardware timer ensuring the system remains responsive.
This log means the system skipped one check due to high CPU load ‚Äî not an error.

Still, keep an eye on watchdog timeouts or kernel panics ‚Äî they can signal instability or hardware failure.

### dmesg
```
cat dmesg
```
Nothing suspicious appeared this time, but I learned that dmesg captures:

Boot logs

Kernel driver messages

Device insertions (like USBs)

üí° Next Lab Idea:
I‚Äôll insert a USB drive and see the detection event in dmesg ‚Äî perfect for forensic training.

### Reflection
Today I revisited Linux fundamentals through a security lens.
Each log told a story ‚Äî from authentication events to kernel watchdogs ‚Äî and I got hands-on practice connecting commands to real log output.

Learning something new every day!
